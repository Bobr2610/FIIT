Below is an example of Python code that uses the Moscow Exchange ISS API endpoint to fetch and display currency exchange rate data. You can add this file (for example, name it `moex_currency.py`) to your FIIT repository and run it with Python 3. (Make sure you have the `requests` library installed—if not, install it using `pip install requests`.)

Feel free to adapt the code further to suit your repository’s structure and needs.

### Explanation & Further Ideas

- **Endpoint & Fields:**  
  The URL used accesses MOEX’s ISS API for currency securities on the "CETS" board. The data structure typically has two main sections: one for securities metadata (like the instrument code and previous quote) and one for market data (such as the last traded price). Adjust the field names as necessary if MOEX changes their API.

- **Error Handling:**  
  The code includes basic error handling for network issues and for unexpected JSON data structures.

- **Enhancements:**  
  • Combine additional market data fields (e.g., volume, daily range) as needed.  
  • Add command-line parameters to select a specific currency pair or to refresh the data at set intervals.  
  • Integrate with other parts of your FIIT repository to further process or visualize the fetched data (for example, plotting trends or integrating with a database). 

I hope this code snippet gets you started with fetching and displaying MOEX currency exchange data. If you're curious about further integration techniques or advanced data handling (like asynchronous fetching or more robust error handling), there are plenty of avenues to explore!
